		<P>A website on the same topic, <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Small-Talk">Wiki How Article</a>, has done a MUCH better job (as well as a serious one) than my website. I also noticed there was no use of section tags. I have to do more research into the purpose of section tags, try to find them out in the wild.</P>
