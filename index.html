		<P>A website on the same topic, <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Small-Talk">Wiki How Article</a>, has done a MUCH better job (as well as a serious one) than my website. I also noticed there was no use of section tags. I have to do more research into the purpose of section tags, try to find them out in the wild.</P>

			<h1>Diversity in Tech</h1>
			<p> There is lack of diversity among employees in tech in the gender ratio as well as the white vs. minority ratio. In both the leadership roles and in the non-leadership roles, minorities and especially women are under represented in the major tech companies.   
			</p>
			<p>This under representation is an issue to any society that strives to be a land of freedom and equality. In order to be free, a society's members need equal opportunity to fairly compete for any job and position, and not be held back by merit-less bigotry. To be free, everyone must keep their right to live and better their lives how ever they see fit.
			</p>
			<p>There are few steps that need to be taken to correct the lack of diversity in tech:
				<ul>
					<li>Educational institutions need to re-asses their curriculum--especially the computer science fields--to eliminate inherent biases that disfavor minorities and women.</li>
					<li>Tech companies need to be incentivised to hire diversity. And let the companies that succeed be held in high esteem.</li>
					<li>The culture around tech and STEM fields needs to change. Sexist and bigoted comments that play stereotypes need to be rebuked by consumers.</li>
				</ul>
